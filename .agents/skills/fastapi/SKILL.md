# FastAPI

Official FastAPI skill to write code with best practices, keeping up to date with new versions and features.

## Quick Reference

* Serve frontend apps: use `app.frontend()` or `router.frontend()` for built frontend assets; see [Serve Frontend Apps](#serve-frontend-apps).
* Server-Sent Events (SSE): use `response_class=EventSourceResponse` and `yield`; see [Streaming](#streaming-json-lines-sse-bytes) and [the streaming reference](references/streaming.md).
* JSON Lines and byte streaming: see [the streaming reference](references/streaming.md).
* Dependencies: use `Annotated[..., Depends(...)]`; see [Dependency Injection](#dependency-injection) and [the dependency injection reference](references/dependencies.md) for `yield`, scopes, and class dependencies.
* Response models: prefer return types; use `response_model` when the public response schema differs from the internal return value; see [the response reference](references/responses.md).
* Pydantic models: do not use ellipsis or `RootModel`; see [the Pydantic reference](references/pydantic.md).
* Routing: declare router-level prefix, tags, and shared dependencies on the `APIRouter`; see [the path operation reference](references/path-operations.md).
* Tooling and related libraries: use uv, Ruff, ty, Asyncer, SQLModel, and HTTPX when applicable; see [the other tools reference](references/other-tools.md).

## Use the `fastapi` CLI

Run the development server on localhost with reload:

```bash
fastapi dev
```

Run the production server:

```bash
fastapi run
```

Prefer declaring the entrypoint in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.fastapi]
entrypoint = "my_app.main:app"
```

When adding the entrypoint is not possible, or the user explicitly asks not to, pass the app file path:

```bash
fastapi dev my_app/main.py
```

## Use `Annotated`

Always prefer the `Annotated` style for parameter and dependency declarations. It keeps function signatures working in other contexts, respects the types, and allows reusability.

Use `Annotated` for parameter declarations, including `Path`, `Query`, `Header`, etc.:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import FastAPI, Path, Query

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(
    item_id: Annotated[int, Path(ge=1, description="The item ID")],
    q: Annotated[str | None, Query(max_length=50)] = None,
):
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

Use `Annotated` for dependencies with `Depends()`. Unless asked not to, create a new type alias for the dependency to allow reusing it:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


def get_current_user():
    return {"username": "johndoe"}


CurrentUserDep = Annotated[dict, Depends(get_current_user)]


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_item(current_user: CurrentUserDep):
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

## Do not use Ellipsis for *path operations* or Pydantic models

Do not use `...` as a default value for required parameters or model fields. It's not needed and not recommended.

```python
from typing im
